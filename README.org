#+TITLE: Playgrounds

Very often I need a space to simply /do/ things without a project or pretext. At
the moment of writing this, I lack a proper way to do this /ad-hoc/. =nix-shell=
and Emacs are wonderful tools that get me close, however I am still tethered to
/files/. Until I am free of files, this playground serves a purpose.

Do you follow so far?

In order for this space to be useful, you will need Emacs and Nix. Run =direnv
allow= here and this space will become even more useful to you.
